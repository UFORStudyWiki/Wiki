<h1>What is GPS?</h1>
<p>GPS stands for Global Positioning System. It is a group of government satellites made by the U.S. to provide accurate information on global/geographical positioning and navigation accessible from anywhere on the Earth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p><strong>Space Segment - satellites</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>GPS uses 24 satellites (3 of them are extras and are not active) that complete their orbit every 12 hours. Their orbits are situated so that on any point on the Earth's surface there are always 5 to 8 satellites above the horizon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Control Segment - ground stations</strong></p>
<p>We have a total of 5 ground-based control stations</p>
<p><strong>User Segment - receivers</strong></p>
<p>This component is often where the human in the GPS comes in. GPS receivers and other users who compute velocity, time, and position using the satellite signals. The resulting information is often used for navigational purposes.</p>
