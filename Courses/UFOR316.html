<p>This is a section for UFOR 316.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for doing well in this course, based upon a friendly peer's observation and experience:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fill in the tree info datasheets early!! Do not wait until the last few days to fill and print. You may face one of the following: 1) was unable to fill them all in time, or 2) the printer fails in some way.</li>
  <li>Choose your trees outside of campus, and take photos for the final project early (September - October). When it comes to November and December, all the foliage is gone, which might not be in your favour.</li>
  <li>Attend the tree walk. The tree walk will help you get to know the species in person. Try to come on time.</li>
</ol>
