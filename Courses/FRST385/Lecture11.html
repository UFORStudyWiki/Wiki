<h1>Learning objectives</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Explain what happens to the density of a snowpack over the course of a snow season</li>
  <li>Discuss the phases of snowmelt and explain what it means for snow to be isothermal</li>
  <li>Compare the factors that influence snow accumulation in an open site vs. a forested site, and between different forest types</li>
  <li>Illustrate the direction (positive/negative) and relative magnitude of local energy exchanges on the snowpack under various weather conditions</li>
  <li>Compare the factors that influence snow ablation in an open site vs. a forested site, and between different forest types</li>
  <li>Explain which components of the local energy balance would be most adversely affected by forest harvesting</li>
  <li>Describe the radiative paradox and where it typically occurs</li>
  <li>Calculate SWE from field snow survey data</li>
  <li>Calculate and compare ablation rates for an open and forested site</li>
  <li>Define with your own words, and put into context, all the terms in the glossary at the end</li>

<h1>Fundamentals of snow</h1>
<h2>Importance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>on average, 60% of Northern Hemisphere has snow in mid-winter</li>
  <li>Major source of drinking water in Canada</li>
  <li>Snow is typically in mountains and so are most of our forests</li>
  <li>BC â€“ flooding (rain on snow) resulting in increased erosion rates and structural damages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Snowpack: accumulated snow on the ground at a time of measurement</li>
  <li>Snowfall: precipitation that falls as snow</li>
  <li>Snow water equilavent (SWE) amount of liquid water present in a snowpack</li>
  <li>Peak SWE (maximum SWE recorded prior to melting)</li>
  <li>Snow depth (d) thickness of a snowpack [m]; perpendicular to mean sea level</li>
  <li>Snow density: mass of snow in a given volume</li>
  <li>Snow cover: fraction of area covered by snow [%]</li>
  <li>Snow melt: change of snow to liquid water resulting from energy inputs [mm / day]</li>
  <li>Snow ablation: loss of mass from a snowpack by the combination of wind transport, sublimation, and/or melt [mm / day]</li>
</ul>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New snowfall typically has a density of around 100 kg / m<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li>Winter snowpack's typically have mean densities between 200 and 300 kg m<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li>The density of a snowpack reflects the characteristics of the various snowfall events and various processes such as snow compaction and snow melt and refreeze cycles</li>
  <li>SWE can be calculated by knowing snow density and depth</li>
</ul>
