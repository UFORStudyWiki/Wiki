<h1>Fundamentals of snow</h1>
<h2>Importance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>on average, 60% of Northern Hemisphere has snow in mid-winter</li>
  <li>Major source of drinking water in Canada</li>
  <li>Snow is typically in mountains and so are most of our forests</li>
  <li>BC – flooding (rain on snow) resulting in increased erosion rates and structural damages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Snowpack: accumulated snow on the ground at a time of measurement</li>
  <li>Snowfall: precipitation that falls as snow</li>
  <li>Snow water equilavent (SWE) amount of liquid water present in a snowpack</li>
  <li>Peak SWE (maximum SWE recorded prior to melting)</li>
  <li>Snow depth (d) thickness of a snowpack [m]; perpendicular to mean sea level</li>
  <li>Snow density: mass of snow in a given volume</li>
  <li>Snow cover: fraction of area covered by snow [%]</li>
  <li>Snow melt: change of snow to liquid water resulting from energy inputs [mm / day]</li>
  <li>Snow ablation: loss of mass from a snowpack by the combination of wind transport, sublimation, and/or melt [mm / day]</li>
</ul>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New snowfall typically has a density of around 100 kg / m<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li>Winter snowpack's typically have mean densities between 200 and 300 kg m<sup>3</sup></li>
  <li>The density of a snowpack reflects the characteristics of the various snowfall events and various processes such as snow compaction and snow melt and refreeze cycles</li>
  <li>SWE can be calculated by knowing snow density and depth</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Phases of snowmelt</h1>
<ol>
  <li>warming phase: Steady temp increase until snowpack is isothermal at 0C</li>
  <li>Ripening phase: Melting occurs but water is retained in snowpack until Isothermal (0C) snowpack at the end of the phase cannot retain more liquid water.</li>
  <li>Output phase: further inputs of energy produce water output.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Processes might not be steady; snow melting in the surface releases water that percolates through the snowpack, refreezes, and raises temperature by releasing latent heat.</p>
<p>Snowpack temperature varies during the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snowpack is ripe when it is primed to release liquid water: when snowpack temperature is 0C and the liquid-water-holding capacity of the snowpack has been reached. Any additional input of either energy or liquid water will then be released from the bottom of the pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Factors influencing snowpack</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Energy: Higher energy == higher melting</li>
  <li>Slope: There is a larger snowpack in the North, because the South slope has greater shortwave energy from the sun and a higher melt-rate</li>
  <li>Logging: There is more shortwave energy entering the snowpack because of less cover from shortwave radiation from vegetation, trees, etc. decreasing overall snowpack .<ul>
      <li>When combined with slope, we can see that there will be even greater impact on the South slope.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vegetation: Canopy density &amp; type also impacts snowpack. There is more energy under spruce than there is under pine. Likely to be more energy under deciduous than coniferous trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Ablation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>As forest cover decreases, interception decreases (more accuulation) and melt rates increase (faster snow dissapearance).</li>
  <li>Cases where greater melt rates occur under a denser forest have been termed “radiative paradox”, where increases in long-wave radiation with increasing canopy cover are greater than corresponding decreases in shortwave radiation.<ul>
      <li>These conditions are likely to occur with low atmospheric emissivities, high snow albedos, and low solar elevations, are more common on shaded, poleward facing slopes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>R<sub>n</sub> = K↓ - K↑ + L↓ - L↑&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forest cover increases &gt;&gt;&gt; K* decreases &gt;&gt;&gt; L↑&nbsp;loss decreases &gt;&gt;&gt; L↓ gain from the forest canopy increases.</li>
  <li>R<sub>n</sub> is minimum at around 20% canopy cover, but increases at dense forest canopy conditions because of the much higher L↓ radiation gains emitted by the forest canopy.</li>
  <li>R<sub>n </sub>is still highest at 0% forest cover (open) with large input from K* radiation.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Snow measurements</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Lysimeters</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic snow depth sensors</li>
  <li>Snow pillows</li>
  <li>Remote sensing<ul>
      <li>Satellite optical measurements – snow cover</li>
      <li>Satellite passive microwave – SWE</li>
      <li>Satellite active microwave – SWE</li>
      <li>Hyperspectral radiometers – snow grain size</li>
      <li>Airborne gamma – SWE</li>
      <li>Airborne LiDAR – Snow depth</li>
      <li>Satellite optical measurements – snow albedo</li>
      <li>Limitations:<ul>
          <li>Low spatial resolutions</li>
          <li>High cost</li>
          <li>Specializing processing (LiDAR or microwave)</li>
          <li>Low accuracy (gross empirical indirect estimations) E.g., SWE from microwave</li>
