<h1>Learning objectives</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Explain what happens to the density of a snowpack over the course of a snow season</li>
  <li>Discuss the phases of snowmelt and explain what it means for snow to be isothermal</li>
  <li>Compare the factors that influence snow accumulation in an open site vs. a forested site, and between different forest types</li>
  <li>Illustrate the direction (positive/negative) and relative magnitude of local energy exchanges on the snowpack under various weather conditions</li>
  <li>Compare the factors that influence snow ablation in an open site vs. a forested site, and between different forest types</li>
  <li>Explain which components of the local energy balance would be most adversely affected by forest harvesting</li>
  <li>Describe the radiative paradox and where it typically occurs</li>
  <li>Calculate SWE from field snow survey data</li>
  <li>Calculate and compare ablation rates for an open and forested site</li>
  <li>Define with your own words, and put into context, all the terms in the glossary at the end</li>
</ol>
