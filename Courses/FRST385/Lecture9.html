<h1>Runoff Processes</h1>
<h2>Runoff within the water &amp; energy balances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>D – Direct precipitation</li>
  <li>O – Overland Flow</li>
  <li>Ss – Subsurface flow</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water balance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Falls under Q; is an intermediary process</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy Balance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kinetic energy (E<sub>k</sub>)</li>
  <li>Potential energy (gravitational potential, pressure potential, matric potential, osmotic potential)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fundamentals of runoff</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Importance:<ul>
      <li>Directly related to erosion</li>
      <li>System responses to precipitation are key to establish flooding risk</li>
      <li>Initiator of landslides</li>
      <li>Directly related to water quality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In humid areas, annual precipitation is disposed of approximately as shown by the percentages listed.</p>
<p><i>Surface stormflow</i> leaves the small basin within minutes, whereas some <i>baseflow </i>may be retained within the soil mantle for years.</p>
<p>Q = P - ET</p>
<ul>
  <li>P = 100%</li>
  <li>ET = 67%</li>
  <li>Q = 33%<ul>
      <li>23% baseflow</li>
      <li>8% subsurface flow</li>
      <li>2% surface stormflow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Subsurface Flow</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“A runoff generating mechanism operating in most upland terrains”</li>
  <li>Occurs when water moves laterally down a hillslope through soil layers or permeable bedrock to contribute to the storm hydrograph</li>
  <li>In humid environments and steep terrain with conductive soils, subsurface flow may be the main mechanism of storm runoff generation</li>
  <li>Subsurface flow rate is highly dependent on <a href="https://notes.greyblockgames.com/en/Courses/FRST385/Lecture6"><strong>hydraulic conductivity</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>micropore (matrix) flow</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Upward and downwards flow</li>
</ul>
<h3>macropore flow</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Downward flow only</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overland flow</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Infiltration-excess overland flow</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most likely in arid and semiarid landscapes where vegetation densities and infiltration rates are low, or in disturbed areas<ul>
      <li>Hortonion overland flow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Saturation-excess overland flow</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Develops where soil becomes saturation by perennial groundwater table rising to the surface or by lateral or vertical percolation above an impeding horizon</li>
  <li><strong>Tends to dominate quickflow</strong> in thickly vegetated landscapes with<strong> thin soils</strong>, high water tables, and long gentle concave hillslopes</li>
  <li>Subsurface flow and saturation overland flow might both be simultaneously important</li>
</ul>
<h3>Variable source area</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Because of temporal and spatial variation of zones generating subsurface stormflow, the terms <i><strong>variable source area concept</strong></i> and <i><strong>dynamic watershed concept</strong></i> were created.<ul>
      <li>The flow of water in a stream at any given moment is under the influence of a dynamic, expanding or shrinking source area</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The area actively involved in producing quickly varies from <strong>less than 1% </strong>to <strong>more than 50% </strong>in extreme storms.<ul>
      <li>Stormflow &amp; source area will increase at the beginning &amp; decrease at the end of a storm / snowmelt event<ul>
          <li>Caused by subsurface flow &amp; channel expansion / shrinkage&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
