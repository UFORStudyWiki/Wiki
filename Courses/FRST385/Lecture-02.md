# Learning Objectives
1. Explain the watershed concept and why it is the main spatial unit used in hydrology
2. List the five factors that determine watershed characteristics
3. Explain at least eight specific watershed parameters
4. Infer how watershed characteristics (soil type, mean slope, etc.) may affect different response factors
5. Sketch the global and terrestrial hydrologic cycles with their major sotrages and processes
6. Understand the major components of the hydrologic cycle
7. Write and understand the basic water balance equation
8. Define with your own words, and put into context, all the terms in the glossary.

# Watershed concept
## Definition
* The area that appears on the basis of topography to contribute all the water that passes through a given cross section of a stream
* An area of land with a topograpic divide that collects rain and snow, discharging most of this water to a stream, river or other water body.
* Synonyms: basin, drainage basin, catchment
