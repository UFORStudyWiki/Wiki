<h1>Atmospheric pressure and relative humidity</h1>
<p>Formation of precipitation requires a 4-stage process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Saturation </strong>of air by cooling to reach dew point temperature</li>
  <li><strong>Condensation </strong>of water vapor to form ice crystals or droplets</li>
  <li><strong>Growth </strong>of droplets or crystals into raindrops, snowflakes, or hailstones, to a size large enough to fall to the ground before evaporating</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous input </strong>of water vapor to sustain the process (depending on vertical wind and humidity)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relative humidity = Actual water vapor pressure / maximum water vapor pressure at a specific air temperature X 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Uplifting mechanisms</h1>
<p>Precipitation originates from different uplifting mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convective<ul>
      <li>Results from strong heating of air near ground (unstable) that expands, becomes lighter, and rises</li>
      <li>Causes adiabatic cooling</li>
      <li>Cells typically 10s of km apart</li>
      <li>Precipitation is intense, heavy, and short-lived</li>
      <li>Associated with thunderstorms and hail</li>
      <li>Highly patched rainfall patterns; might not be detected by rain gauge</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergent (frontal or non-frontal)<ul>
      <li>Frontal:<ul>
          <li>Warm front<ul>
              <li>Warm air is less dense than cold air and easily slides up gradually pushing the cold air out of the way.</li>
              <li>In BC, comes from the ocean</li>
              <li>precipitation Covers large areas, is not intense, and longer lasting</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Cold front<ul>
              <li>Cold air is denser than the warm air mass it replaces. As the cold air moves into the warm air, it forces it to rise quickly.</li>
              <li>Results in deeper clouds and heavier precipitation than in warm fronts</li>
              <li>Precipitation covers a smaller area and is more intense</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Orographic<ul>
      <li>Air moving horizontally hits a topographic barrier</li>
      <li>Hills and mountains deflect air upwards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>Errors in ground-based measurements</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wind</strong>: increased wind results in decrease in catch</li>
  <li><strong>Evaporation and wetting</strong>: Handling traces is problematic</li>
  <li><strong>Splashback</strong>: Gauges are usually mounted 1.5 - 2 m above ground the minimize splash but mounting closer to ground reduces wind effects</li>
  <li><strong>Location of gauge</strong>: observe angle and distance to obstructions</li>
</ul>
<h1>Spatial interpolation</h1>
<p>Process of using points with known values to estimate values at other points</p>
