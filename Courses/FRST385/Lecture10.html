<h1>Rating Curves</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Empirical relationship between state and discharge</li>
  <li>Less time consuming than other methods</li>
  <li>Applicable to streams where stage is easy to measure</li>
</ul>
<p>Q = a(h - h<sub>0</sub>)<sup>b</sup></p>
<p><sup>Where h = stage, H</sup><sub><sup>0</sup></sub><sup>= stage of no flow, a and b = empirical local parameters</sup></p>
