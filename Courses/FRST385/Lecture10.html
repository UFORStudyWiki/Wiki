<h1>Rating Curves</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Empirical relationship between state and discharge</li>
  <li>Less time consuming than other methods</li>
  <li>Applicable to streams where stage is easy to measure</li>
  <li>Assumptions: stable channel bed, steady flow (constant velocities)</li>
</ul>
<p>Q = a(h - h<sub>0</sub>)<sup>b</sup></p>
<p><sup>Where h = stage, H</sup><sub><sup>0</sup></sub><sup>= stage of no flow, a and b = empirical local parameters</sup></p>
<h1><sup>Weirs and flumes</sup></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-calibrated structures for small watersheds (&lt; 800 ha)</li>
  <li>Weirs and flumes: stable cross section; known empirical relationship between stage and discharge</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal conditions for installation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Straight channel</li>
  <li>Channel constriction (not expansion)</li>
  <li>Stable bed and banks</li>
  <li>Little or no overbank flow</li>
  <li>Single channel</li>
  <li>No backwater influence (tributary, estuary, ice, debris)</li>
  <li>Little flow turbulence</li>
  <li>Look for natural weirs</li>
</ul>
<h1>Dilution gauging</h1>
<p>Method of gauging streams that have a high amount of turbulence and/or a very inconsistent cross-sectional area (e.g., most mountain streams)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Based on the proportional relationship between electric conductivity and concentration of tracers in water<ul>
      <li>Typical tracers: common salt, rhodamine dye</li>
      <li>Very accurate if stream reach properly chosen</li>
      <li><strong>Reach </strong>(section between injection and measurement) should be approximately 25 times as long as stream width, with no channels entering or splitting away from it.</li>
      <li>Sufficient turbulence is required to properly mix the solution</li>
      <li>All dilution gauging requires the use of a tracer measurable at low concentrations</li>
      <li>Tracer should not react with anything in the stream or be harmful to the environment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Common tracers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Salt (NaCl)<ul>
      <li>Inexpensive</li>
      <li>Readily available</li>
      <li>Simple to measure as electrical conductivity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine)<ul>
      <li>Detectable to parts per billion</li>
      <li>Can assess mixing visually</li>
      <li>Requires expensive fluorometers to measure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Empirical Equation</h1>
<h2>Manning's equation</h2>
<p>Q = V X A</p>
<p>V = 1/n(R<sub>h</sub><sup>⅔</sup>S<sup>½</sup>)</p>
<p>V = average velocity in stream cross-section [m/s]</p>
<p>R<sub>h</sub> = hydraulic radius (m) = A / WP</p>
<p>A = Cross-sectional area m<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>WP = wetted perimeter [m]</p>
<p>s = energy slope (approximated by water surface slope) [m m<sup>-1</sup>]</p>
<p>n = roughness coefficient</p>
<h2>Applicability of Manning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When there is no gauging station</li>
  <li>When peak discharge is beyond highest measured stage</li>
  <li>When peak discharge of previous flood is of interest</li>
</ul>
