<p>Forest cover doesn't just affect small and medium but also larger floods; The larger the flood, the larger the forest cover and said flood. How large is large? Younes says large is any larger than a 10 year flood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument of the new paradigm is of the most fundamental nature. It targets the previously held hypothesis, controls, etc.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The previous paradigm was caused by “being fooled by randomness”.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Younes' work argues against previous hydrology works stating that they're uncontrolled; they're using the science method wrong and are unable to establish causation. The wrong paradigm has guided forest hydrology to the current position and has influences every single aspect. Every single research project has used the same methodology.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Scientific paradigms</h1>
<p>“A collection of beliefs and agreements, shared by scientists, that guides the research efforts of scientific communities, and by which a field of inquiry is most clearly identified as a science”</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subscribers of old paradigms will fight for their old paradigm to “save their pride”</li>
  <li>Science must be objective; scientists are humans and therefore cannot be objective. They are subjective by nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonymous peer reviewers and journal-editors make it difficult for Younes and lab to release research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Forest hydrology has a sad history of being embroiled in controversies that never seem to get resolved”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
