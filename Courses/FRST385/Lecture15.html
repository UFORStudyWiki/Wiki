<p>Forest cover doesn't just affect small and medium but also larger floods; The larger the flood, the larger the forest cover and said flood. How large is large? Younes says large is any larger than a 10 year flood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument of the new paradigm is of the most fundamental nature. It targets the previously held hypothesis, controls, etc.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The previous paradigm was caused by “being fooled by randomness”.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Younes' work argues against previous hydrology works stating that they're uncontrolled; they're using the science method wrong and are unable to establish causation. The wrong paradigm has guided forest hydrology to the current position and has influences every single aspect. Every single research project has used the same methodology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past 100 years of forest hydrology has not looked at frequency</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grand forks, first flood &nbsp;of high level 1948; second time 2018; flood level has repeatedly come close to the 2018 levels over the past 4 years.</p>
<h1>Scientific paradigms</h1>
<p>“A collection of beliefs and agreements, shared by scientists, that guides the research efforts of scientific communities, and by which a field of inquiry is most clearly identified as a science”</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subscribers of old paradigms will fight for their old paradigm to “save their pride”</li>
  <li>Science must be objective; scientists are humans and therefore cannot be objective. They are subjective by nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonymous peer reviewers and journal-editors make it difficult for Younes and lab to release research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Forest hydrology has a sad history of being embroiled in controversies that never seem to get resolved” (consensus virtually does not exist in any forest science field, if we have real consensus it has nothing to do with the establishing causation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disagreements among scientists are common in many fields of studies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wouldn't be “nice to know why and how highly competent scientists can repeatedly come up with completely contradictory results?”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Old paradigm</h1>
<p>Non-causal deterministic reductionist approach.</p>
<p>Unable to draw any connections; has been misused to say stuff that can't be said. As there is randomness, looking at any single event provides misleading info.</p>
<p>As example, it's like trying to determine if cigarettes cause cancer by taking 1 smoker, 1 non-smoker and seeing if either of them develop cancer; basing the answer solely on this one test.</p>
<p>If smoker develops cancer; cigarettes cause 100% cancer rates (untrue). If smoker does not develop cancer; cigarettes don't cause any cancer (also untrue).</p>
<p>If non-smoker develops cancer but smoker does not, cigarettes prevent cancer (untrue). If non-smoker develops cancer and smoker develops cancer (untrue); smoking does not affect cancer rates (untrue).</p>
<p>Current paradigm with forest effects on floods is a dogma / belief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reductionist (it reasons one storm at a time) and deterministic (it doesn't invoke the stochastic aspect of floods).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stochastic: randomly determined; having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>History: Sponge theory</h2>
<p>The role of forest in flood generation ahs been conceptualized around a century-old “sponge theory”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forest is imagined to soak up water during storm and releases it later on (Pinchot, 1905)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>New paradigm</h1>
<p>Frequency pairing</p>
<h1>Important stuff to know</h1>
<p>Calculating return period based on exceedance.</p>
