<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Roads</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Road cuts are very important<ul>
      <li>There is a natural slope for a material. When a cut is made too steep, the terrain will try to become the original slope again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drainage network<ul>
      <li>Artificial increase of drainage network due to road construction and skidding (smaller roads for removing trees)</li>
      <li>Certain road networks may reduce streamflow by diverting it to other watersheds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Roads are operationally very critical for two reasons:<ul>
      <li>Road effects are more permanent because they do not recover unless decommissioned (rarely done in practice)</li>
      <li>Road effects become more critical for larger watersheds as the chances of road ditches interconnecting with stream network increases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Potential contamination</h2>
<p>Caused by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pest control</li>
  <li>Fertilization<ul>
      <li>Nitrogen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Industrial spills<ul>
      <li>Fuel, oil</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hydrologic effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Water quality</li>
  <li>Groundwater</li>
</ul>
<h1>Hydrologic effects</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Water quantity<ul>
      <li>Nearly all harvesting activities result in increased streamflow:<ul>
          <li>Soil compaction, increased stream density, vegetation removal (less ET → more Q)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Magnitude, frequency, and duration of low, mean, and high flows must be evaluated</li>
      <li>Must characterize watershed “behavior” in response to forest operations<ul>
          <li>Paved watersheds make it flashier</li>
          <li>Forested watersheds make it calmer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Water Quality</li>
  <li>Extreme events</li>
</ul>
<p>Deterministic determinations do not invoke probability.</p>
<h1>Guidelines of best practices</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Apply silvicultural methods that resemble the natural disturbance &amp; regeneration strategy for particular forest types.</li>
  <li>Protect streams with no-harvest buffers (e.g., minimum 20 m to each side of the stream).</li>
  <li>Avoid land use practices that reduce infiltration capacity and soil permeability (DO NOT COMPACT SOIL)</li>
  <li>Minimize exposure of mineral soil / protect the soil</li>
  <li>Avoid logging on steep slopes<ul>
      <li>At the least, use proper equipment such as helicopters to prevent undue damage to the slopes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Channelize runoff towards stable areas (avoiding steep &amp; susceptible)</li>
  <li>Applying erosion control techniques and promote infiltration</li>
  <li>Minimize road density<ul>
      <li>Few roads as possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use guidelines for proper road &amp; drainage construction</li>
  <li>Carefully analyze soil susceptibility to erosion and landslides with maps of terrain stability.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Off topic ramblings</h1>
<p>Cause ≠ effect; If we look at a single event, we can't say anything one way or another. We must look at multiple events to make any inference about anything. &nbsp;Professor Lauri Daniels knows stuff about wildfire but she has no idea about watershed hydrology. Therefore she needs to stop talking about watershed stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supposedly Yunes is ignorant outside of hydrology. Turns out British Law used in the commonwealth, cause is determined via probabilistic methods. <mark class="marker-yellow">Convincing a judge about the watershed hydrology is much easier than convincing ignorant foresters</mark>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deterministic determinations do not invoke probability. It is old reasoning. It leads to learned helplessness. Probabilistic thinking challenges old held ideas, therefore foresters are against it.</p>
