<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Roads</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Road cuts are very important<ul>
      <li>There is a natural slope for a material. When a cut is made too steep, the terrain will try to become the original slope again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drainage network<ul>
      <li>Artificial increase of drainage network due to road construction and skidding (smaller roads for removing trees)</li>
      <li>Certain road networks may reduce streamflow by diverting it to other watersheds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Roads are operationally very critical for two reasons:<ul>
      <li>Road effects are more permanent because they do not recover unless decommissioned (rarely done in practice)</li>
      <li>Road effects become more critical for larger watersheds as the chances of road ditches interconnecting with stream network increases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Potential contamination</h2>
<p>Caused by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pest control</li>
  <li>Fertilization<ul>
      <li>Nitrogen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Industrial spills<ul>
      <li>Fuel, oil</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hydrologic effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Water quality</li>
  <li>Groundwater</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Hydrologic effects</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Water quantity</li>
  <li>Water Quality</li>
  <li>Extreme events</li>
</ul>
<p>Deterministic determinations do not invoke probability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Off topic ramblings</h1>
<p>Cause â‰  effect; If we look at a single event, we can't say anything one way or another. We must look at multiple events to make any inference about anything. &nbsp;Professor Lauri Daniels knows stuff about wildfire but she has no idea about watershed hydrology. Therefore she needs to stop talking about watershed stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supposedly Yunes is ignorant outside of hydrology. Turns out British Law used in the commonwealth, cause is determined via probabilistic methods. <mark class="marker-yellow">Convincing a judge about the watershed hydrology is much easier than convincing ignorant foresters</mark>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deterministic determinations do not invoke probability. It is old reasoning. It leads to learned helplessness. Probabilistic thinking challenges old held ideas, therefore foresters are against it.</p>
