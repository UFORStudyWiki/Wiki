<p>Deterministic determinations do not invoke probability.</p>
<h1>Off topic ramblings</h1>
<p>Cause â‰  effect; If we look at a single event, we can't say anything one way or another. We must look at multiple events to make any inference about anything. &nbsp;Professor Lauri Daniels knows stuff about wildfire but she has no idea about watershed hydrology. Therefore she needs to stop talking about watershed stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supposedly Yunes is ignorant outside of hydrology. Turns out British Law used in the commonwealth, cause is determined via probabilistic methods. <mark class="marker-yellow">Convincing a judge about the watershed hydrology is much easier than convincing ignorant foresters</mark>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deterministic determinations do not invoke probability. It is old reasoning. It leads to learned helplessness. Probabilistic thinking challenges old held ideas, therefore foresters are against it.</p>
