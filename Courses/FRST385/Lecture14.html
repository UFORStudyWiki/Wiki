<h1>Learning objectives</h1>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;List three forestry activities that can impact a watershed and explain how they influence the local hydrology.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Explain how soil disturbances from forestry activities can alter runoff mechanisms in a watershed.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Describe the effect of forest service roads on the drainage network.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Provide an example of how logging practices can negatively impact water quality.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;List at least three solutions to reduce the impact of forest harvesting on water resources.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Define with your own words, and put into context, all the terms in the glossary at the end.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Forestry Activities</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Road construction<ul>
      <li>For moving around equipment (harvest, planting, everything else)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Felling, skidding, yarding<ul>
      <li>Cutting down tree</li>
      <li>Remove tree</li>
      <li>Sorting out logs; lots of compaction due to lots of moving equipment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vegetation removal</li>
  <li>Planting</li>
  <li>Chemical use</li>
</ul>
<h2>Physical effects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soil exposure and loss<ul>
      <li>Transport of soil particles from the surface by water and wind caused by a combination of:<ul>

<p>Deterministic determinations do not invoke probability.</p>
<h1>Off topic ramblings</h1>
<p>Cause â‰  effect; If we look at a single event, we can't say anything one way or another. We must look at multiple events to make any inference about anything. &nbsp;Professor Lauri Daniels knows stuff about wildfire but she has no idea about watershed hydrology. Therefore she needs to stop talking about watershed stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supposedly Yunes is ignorant outside of hydrology. Turns out British Law used in the commonwealth, cause is determined via probabilistic methods. <mark class="marker-yellow">Convincing a judge about the watershed hydrology is much easier than convincing ignorant foresters</mark>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deterministic determinations do not invoke probability. It is old reasoning. It leads to learned helplessness. Probabilistic thinking challenges old held ideas, therefore foresters are against it.</p>
