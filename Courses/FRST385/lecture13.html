<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>estimate the probability and risk of damage to populations and infrastructure</li>
  <li>understand impacts of weather and land change impacts on extreme events</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>flooding is the most destructive disaster worldwide. Most common. Incredibly costly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>probability density function (pdf): a function that roughly models a distribution.</p>
<p>return period: the time it takes on average for Q to happen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: discharge&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probability = 1/tr</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tr = 1/p</p>
<p><br>area under the probability density curve is always 1</p>
<p>normal distribution only has 2 variables (mean and deviation.</p>
<p>some distributions have a third parameter, skewness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
