<h1>Objectives</h1>
<ul>
  <li>estimate the probability and risk of damage to populations and infrastructure</li>
  <li>understand impacts of weather and land change impacts on extreme events</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Reason</h1>
<p>flooding is the most destructive disaster worldwide. Most common. Incredibly costly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Definitions</h1>
<p>probability density function (pdf): a function that roughly models a distribution.</p>
<p>return period: the time it takes on average for Q to happen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: discharge&nbsp;<br>P: probability<br>Tr: return period</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Equations</h1>
<ul>
  <li>p = 1/tr</li>
  <li>Tr = 1/p</li>
</ul>
<h1>Nuances</h1>
<p><br>area under the probability density curve is always 1</p>
<p>normal distribution only has 2 variables (mean and variance).</p>
<p>some distributions, such as Gumbel, have a third parameter (skewness).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Assumptions of flood frequency analysis</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Time series of floods is a set of independent observations.. This assures that a hydrologic event such as a single large storm does not enter the data set more than once. A single storm system may produce two or more runoff peaks, only the largest should enter the data set.</li>
  <li>The time series of floods is homogeneous. This assures that all the flood observations are from the same population, for instance:<ol>
      <li>Stream gauge has not been relocated</li>
      <li>Land use change has not occured</li>
      <li>No structures have been placed on the stream or its tributaries</li>
      <li>There are no major natural lakes upstream of the stream gauge</li>
      <li>Climate has not changed or changes are accounted for</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>Two methods for frequency analysis</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Graphical method:<ul>
      <li>Using data records to estimate Tr and P within the observed data.<ul>
          <li>Rank magnitude from largest to smallest. Largest = 1; smallest = n</li>
          <li>Calculate exceedance probability [p = m / (n + 1)] &nbsp;or return period [(Tr) = (n + 1) / m]&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analytical method<ul>
      <li>Using a theoretical pdf to extrapolate beyond the observed record</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
