# Formulas

$V = \bar{Q} \times{} \Delta{}t$

Volume of Quickfly: $QF = P \times{} A_S$

$A_S = QF/P$



# About the exam
Questions are very similar to the lab. 

# Random information
Floods are very stochastic

Analyzing graphs: Weather extremes, precipitation extremes, temperature extremes. Can only be examined under frequency analysis. 

We've spent 4/5 lectures talking about this: Younes method. 

Pay attention to lecture 14 / 15.

Focus on problems conquored on labs. Understand the equations, parameters, etc. how everything was applied and how. 

Two categories of problems. Majority are problems seen on labs. Most quantitative, the occasional conceptual sub-question.

9 questions on the final.
* 8 are quantitative
* 1 is conceptual

Covers forest & floods, environmental controls, investigation of sciences.

Probabilistic framework is of high importance.

We need to step back and ask: "how did harvesting affect variability, form of distribution, mean, skewness: extent to which results differs from the curve".

Skewness

Floods are not normally distributed, they are skewed. Some are skewed left, some are skewed right. Papers are restricted to the first couple of variables to make things simpler. Logging affects the third parameter as well. 

On frequency curves:
* When the mean increases, curve shifts up. When mean decreases, curve shifts down.
* When the variability increases, the curve tilt increases.

Anything that desynchronizes, decreases variability.
Anything that synchronizes, increases variability.

In most cases, logging increases variability.

What happens when we build roads?
* Compacted soils, suppress all storage, more infiltration-excess runoff. 
* Connecting streams via ditches

What happens when we take out trees by helicopter so that we don't disturb the soil?
* Less evapotranspiration, increased soil moisture, less storage, more saturation-excess runoff. 

Wetter soils lead to synchronization.

**Synchronization of water to the outlet.**
* Could also be refered to as the efficiency of water being delivered to the outlet.


If we do not invoke frequency, our investigation is non-causal. 



Understand all the equations for lab 5.


# Zero flux plane

Two things inside:
* Ground water table elevation
* zero flux plane *displays upward flux to evapotranspiration demands.

We need to invision a tract of land, fixed at the same place. 



# We are blessed in BC by the following natural stuff:
1. 
2. Topography (lots of snow)
3. Mild Climate
4. Large number of bogs / flood plains / other storage areas for excess runoff.
5. Majestic (before logging) forest.


# statianarity assumption
What breaks the assumption? 

The flood frequency distribution is a frequency distribution.

Mean, mean variability, skewness. If these parameters are not chaning, frequency will remain stationary.

If the parameters are disturbed via climate, land use, land cover, etc., the frequency will change.

Labs 8 & 9 assume that flood frequency does not change over time (is stationary). 

Non-stationarity is at the core of causatal inference.

# Snow environments
Least important factor of peak is soil wetness.

In rain environments, trees are pumping out soil moisture.

# Otherwise

Causes our curves to be mild & concave.

Logging not on final
