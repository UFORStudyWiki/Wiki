<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Processes at the ground layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>F — &nbsp;infiltration</li>
  <li>L — &nbsp; Lateral flow</li>
  <li>Pe – percolation</li>
  <li>Ss – subsurface flow</li>
</ul>
<p>Infiltration (F) – The process by which water arriving at the soil surface enters the soil.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;does not show up on the water balance equation but is an important intermediary process.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In this course, we also call all processes related to water movement in the unsaturated zone infiltration</li>
  <li>Water moves in the soil via capillary and gravitational forces through micropores and macropores</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four possibilities for water in the soil:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Held in the soil</strong> (if moisture is below field capacity (FC))</li>
  <li><strong>Evaporation </strong>back to the atmosphere</li>
  <li><strong>Percolation downwards </strong>to groundwater</li>
  <li><strong>Reaches a stream</strong> via subsurface flow (saturated zone)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infiltration rate: rate at which water enters the soil from the surface; decreases as 0v increases</li>
  <li>water input rate: rate at which water arrives at the surface</li>
  <li>Infiltration capacity: maximum rate at which infiltration can occur</li>
  <li>Cumulative infiltration: accumulated depth of water infiltrated over a given time period. Equal to the integral of infiltration rate over that period</li>
  <li>Ponding: accumulation of water in the surface when w(t) is igher than f(t)</li>
  <li>Depth of ponding: depth of water that is ponding</li>
</ul>
