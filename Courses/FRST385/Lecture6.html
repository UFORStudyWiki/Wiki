<p>Processes at the ground layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>F — &nbsp;infiltration</li>
  <li>L — &nbsp; Lateral flow</li>
  <li>Pe – percolation</li>
  <li>Ss – subsurface flow</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infiltration (F) – The process by which water arriving at the soil surface enters the soil.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;does not show up on the water balance equation but is an important intermediary process.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In this course, we also call all processes related to water movement in the unsaturated zone infiltration</li>
  <li>Water moves in the soil via capillary and gravitational forces through micropores and macropores</li>
</ul>
