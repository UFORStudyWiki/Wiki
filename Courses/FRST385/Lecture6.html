<p>Processes at the ground layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>F — &nbsp;infiltration</li>
  <li>L — &nbsp; Lateral flow</li>
  <li>Pe – percolation</li>
  <li>Ss – subsurface flow</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infiltration (F) does not show up on the water balance equation but is an important intermediary process.</p>
<p>Infiltration: The process by which water arriving at the soil surface enters the soil.</p>
