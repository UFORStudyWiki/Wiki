<p>Why is good leadership important in Urban Forestry?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dealing with Staff, Community, Elected &amp; appointed officials / boards of directors</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Must articulate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vision</li>
  <li>Goal &amp; Objective Setting</li>
  <li>Empowerment<ul>
      <li>Green light / yellow light / red light system<ul>
          <li>Green light: all good</li>
          <li>Yellow light: Maybe deadlines pushed back</li>
          <li>Red light: Shit hits the fan; financial loss, political implications</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Training<ul>
      <li>Everything everyone needs is taken care of</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Team Building &amp; Nurturing<ul>
      <li>Norming → Storming → Performing → Forming<ul>
          <li>Forming: learning about each other</li>
          <li>Storming: Challenging each other</li>
          <li>Norming: Working with each other</li>
          <li>Performing: working as one</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good leaders motivates people:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Motivation: M.A.P<ul>
      <li>Mastery: People want to be able to master what they do</li>
      <li>Autonominity: People don't want to be guarded 24/7</li>
      <li>Purpose: People need to know how what they do ties to the bigger picture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three things that lead to job misery = Irrelevance + Anonymity + Immeasurement</p>
<ul>
  <li>Irrelevance: Don't know how work fits into the big picture</li>
  <li>Anonymity: Others don't know anything about you (lack of human connection)</li>
  <li>Immeasurement: Unable to measure what you do</li>
</ul>
