<p>Are cities the same from an ecological perspective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rural vs Exurban</h2>
<p><strong>Both</strong> rural and exurban are sparsely populated areas compared to “urban” zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rural </strong>- surrounded by agricultural land</p>
<p><strong>Exurban</strong> - surrounded by natural habitat ("embedded in a natural habitat matrix", according to the lecture slides)</p>
<h2>Urban Ecology</h2>
