<p>Are cities the same from an ecological perspective?</p>
<h2>Land Use Classification</h2>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Here is what you always include when doing a site description:</mark></p>
<ol>
  <li>Land use classification<ul>
      <li>'Residential'</li>
      <li>'Commercial'</li>
      <li>‘Green area’</li>
      <li>‘Industrial’</li>
      <li>'Conservation'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The dominant human activity on the site</li>
  <li>Variable 1: Urbanization intensity (usually assessed using built cover)<ul>
      <li>The proportion of Impervious Surfaces<ul>
          <li>0 - 33% built cover = “Sparsely developed”</li>
          <li>34 - 66% built cover = “Moderately developed"</li>
          <li>67% - 100% built cover = “Highly developed”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Variable 2: human activities - noise, pedestrian/vehicle activities, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Rural vs Exurban</h2>
<p><strong>Both</strong> rural and exurban are sparsely populated areas compared to “urban” zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rural </strong>- surrounded by agricultural land</p>
<p><strong>Exurban</strong> - surrounded by natural habitat ("embedded in a natural habitat matrix", according to the lecture slides)</p>
<h2>Urban Ecology</h2>
<p>Urban ecology is the ecology in, of, and for cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5 Urban Ecology Principles</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Cities are ecosystem</strong>s - urban ecosystems will still have biotic and abiotic interactions</li>
  <li><strong>Cities are spatially heterogeneous</strong> - urban ecosystems will contain diverse, multidimensional, and remnant/emerging biota distributed heterogeneously across the landscape</li>
  <li><strong>Cities are dynamic</strong> - urban ecosystems will host various natural processes that are heavily reactive to cultural, economic, and regional pressures. Closely related to Principle 4.</li>
  <li><strong>Cities link human and natural processes</strong> - Species richness can be affected by regional socioeconomics. Urban effects can spill/integrate into surrounding rural/natural areas. When wealth correlates with species richness, it is called the <mark class="marker-yellow">Luxury Effect</mark>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cities will still host/operate ecosystem processes</strong> - Nature does not stop after a site is developed.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Remember, Biodiversity is…</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The variability among living&nbsp;<br>organisms, from genes to biomes. This&nbsp;<br>encompasses diversity within, and among,&nbsp;<br>species and ecosystems. (Lecture 5 Slides)</p>

<h2>3 Diversity elements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>Genetic Diversity</strong></span> - Total genetic information of an individual to a group of species. Basically the adaptive capacity of a species/groups of species</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>Species Diversity</strong></span> - Total number and distribution of species that occupy a community<ul>
      <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Species richness</strong></mark> - number of species</li>
      <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Species evenness</strong></mark> - distribution of species</li>
      <li>Species diversity can be viewed by: <i>rarity</i> - low abundance or endemic to a limited region, or <i>impacts</i> - how one species can have a larger footprint on other species than expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>Ecosystem Diversity</strong></span> - Total complexity of an ecosystem<ul>
      <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Vertical diversity</strong></mark> - # of trophic levels</li>
      <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Horizontal diversity</strong></mark> - # of species in one trophic level</li>
      <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Ecosystem function</strong></mark> - all biological and biogeochemical processes that play in a community</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
