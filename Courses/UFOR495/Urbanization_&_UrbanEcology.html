<p>Are cities the same from an ecological perspective?</p>
<h2>Land Use Classification</h2>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Here is what you always include when doing a site description:</mark></p>
<ol>
  <li>Land use classification<ul>
      <li>'Residential'</li>
      <li>'Commercial'</li>
      <li>‘Green area’</li>
      <li>‘Industrial’</li>
      <li>'Conservation'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The dominant human activity on the site</li>
  <li>Variable 1: Urbanization intensity (usually assessed using built cover)<ul>
      <li>The proportion of Impervious Surfaces<ul>
          <li>0 - 33% built cover = “Sparsely developed”</li>
          <li>34 - 66% built cover = “Moderately developed"</li>
          <li>67% - 100% built cover = “Highly developed”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Variable 2: human activities - noise, pedestrian/vehicle activities, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Rural vs Exurban</h2>
<p><strong>Both</strong> rural and exurban are sparsely populated areas compared to “urban” zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rural </strong>- surrounded by agricultural land</p>
<p><strong>Exurban</strong> - surrounded by natural habitat ("embedded in a natural habitat matrix", according to the lecture slides)</p>
<h2>Urban Ecology</h2>
<p>Urban ecology is the ecology in, of, and for cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5 Urban Ecology Principles</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Cities are ecosystem</strong>s - urban ecosystems will still have biotic and abiotic interactions</li>
  <li><strong>Cities are spatially heterogeneous</strong> - urban ecosystems will contain diverse, multidimensional, and remnant/emerging biota distributed heterogeneously across the landscape</li>
  <li><strong>Cities are dynamic</strong> - urban ecosystems will host various natural processes that are heavily reactive to cultural, economic, and regional pressures. Closely related to Principle 4.</li>
  <li><strong>Cities link human and natural processes</strong> - Species richness can be affected by regional socioeconomics. Urban effects can spill/integrate into surrounding rural/natural areas. When wealth correlates with species richness, it is called the <mark class="marker-yellow">Luxury Effect</mark>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cities will still host/operate ecosystem processes</strong> - Nature does not stop after a site is developed.</li>
</ol>
