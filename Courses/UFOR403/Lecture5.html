<h1>10 golden rules for reforestation</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Protect existing forest first<br>- Reforestation doesn't easily compensate for the losses of deforestation<br>- Old- and second-growth, degraded and restored forests are all valuable</li>
  <li>Work together<br>- Involve local communities / stakeholders with interactive participation in every project phase</li>
  <li>Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals<br>- Restoring biodiversity will maximize carbon sequestration &amp; help deliver socio-economic benefits</li>
  <li>Select appropriate areas for reforestation<br>- Only target previously forested lands<br>- Connect or expand existing forest<br>- Do not displace activities that will cause deforestation elsewhere</li>
  <li>Use natural regeneration wherever possible<br>- It can be cheaper and more efficient than tree planting (if conditions are suitable)<br>- Works best on lightly degraded sites or those close to existing forest</li>
  <li>&nbsp;OR Plant species to maximize biodiversity AND Use resilient plant material<br>- Always plant a mix of species<br>- Use as many natives as possible<br>- Include rare, endemic, and endangered species<br>- promote mutualistic interactions<br>- Avoid invasive species<br>AND<br>- Incorporate appropriate genetic variability<br>- Pay attention to provenance</li>
  <li>Plan ahead for infrastructure</li>
  <li>Learn by doing</li>
  <li>Make it pay</li>
</ol>
