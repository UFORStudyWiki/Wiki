# Restoring Biodiversity
- restoring Fynbos
- Restoring the Garry Oak ecosystems
	- 	shrunk by more than 95% since the time of European Contact
	- burning, weeding, planting, herbivore exclusion
- restoring non-plant species
- Examples of restoring habitat for biodiversity
	- -salmon
-food sources
-riparian zones
-â€œgreen" and "blue" routes to allow amphibians and other animals to access ponds? (Connectivity)
-animals that act as ecosystem engineers (eg. beavers)
-daylighting streams in the city
-plant more native plants to support birds
- how can we restore habitat in cities?
	- planting to attract certain species
	- not mowing between highway lanes
	- more permeable surfaces
	- parks
	- pollinator patch
	- rooftop gardens
	- remove invasives
	- green infrastructure
	- hedges
	- yard forest (shrubs, and other plants)
	- allowing wild flowers and weeds to grow (not invasive)
	- Retain trees as wildlife snags or tree features like hollows that are beneficial for wildlife
	- Protecting streams, and incorporating into city planning rather than remove/redirect
	- create greenways planted with native species that could also function as wildlife corridors
	- Reduce pesticide and rodenticide use in cities
	- more soil space
	- effective waste management - prevent algal blooms
