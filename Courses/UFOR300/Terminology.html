<h1>Common Terms</h1>
<h2>A&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>Allelopathy</strong> - the excretion of chemical compounds by plants to inhibit the growth of neighboring plants, increasing the former's competitive advantage. In this course, you should know two species that do this: tall fescue (<i>Festuca arundinacea a.k.a.</i>&nbsp;<i>Schedonorus arundinaceus), and walnut species.</i></p>
<p><strong>Arboriculture</strong> - The holistic maintenance and management of trees at an individual level, while taking into account the urban ecosystem and the environment that the tree is planted in.</p>
<h2>B</h2>
<p>Balled and Burlapped (B &amp; B) production system</p>
<p>Bare root production system</p>
<p><strong>Base course</strong> - Gravel and stone designed to make a stable base for roads and sidewalks. Does not hold water, making it stronger.</p>
<p>Branch collar - Technically a branch “socket”: it is a structure formed on the main trunk around a branch formed by vascular tissues (basically wood) from both the branch and the trunk. It appears as a swollen area around the base of the branch.</p>
<p>Bulk density</p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>Container-grown production system</p>
<p><strong>Cane</strong> - The major stem originating directly from the basal area of a shrub</p>
<h2>D</h2>
<h2>E</h2>
<p>Elemental sulfur - this can be applied to lower soil pH.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>F</h2>
<h2>G</h2>
<p><strong>Graft union</strong> - The place on a grafted tree where the scion meets the rootstock. This can be another point of structural weakness due to the possibility of graft incompatibility.</p>
<h2>H</h2>
<h2>I</h2>
<p><strong>Included bark</strong> - Tree bark that has been sandwiched or enclosed between a branch angle (crotch). This is a major structural weak point of a tree.</p>
<h2>J</h2>
<h2>K</h2>
<h2>L</h2>
<p><strong>Limestone/Lime</strong> - Gravel/infrastructure material that can raise the soil pH dramatically. Typically a nuisance for arboriculture and urban soils.</p>
<h2>M</h2>
