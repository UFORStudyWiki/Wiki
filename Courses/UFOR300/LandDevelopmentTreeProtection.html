<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Densifying leads to pressure on trees</p>
<p>The impacts of land development can alter how a tree grows over longer periods of time (i.e., 10-20 years, if not further, in the future)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gradual loss in mature old trees.</li>
  <li>Makes older trees difficult to attain</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Phases</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Planning and assessment phase<ul>
      <li>Seeing what we have to work with, there will be tradeoffs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assessing the Tree Resource</li>
  <li>Selecting Suitable Trees for Protection<ul>
      <li>Are we able to protect the trees?<ul>
          <li>Can't have trees in the building footprint</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tree Response to Disturbance</li>
  <li>Planning a Protection Strategy</li>
  <li>A Tree Protection Toolkit (online lecture, module 10)</li>
  <li>Operationalizing the Plan</li>
</ul>
