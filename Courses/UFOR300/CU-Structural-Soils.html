<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Structural soils are specially prepared “soils” that can be compacted without limiting plant growth. Typically, structural soils (also called skeletal soils) consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20 % clay</li>
  <li>80% gravel coated with hydrogel to prevent separation from the clay components</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Structural soils were developed by Cornell University for city trees in the mid 90's. The idea has since spread to a myriad of places using local or proprietary materials.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some Californian cities use fist-sized rocks</li>
  <li>Vancouver uses large granite rocks<ul>
      <li>Use of granite eliminates a common issue with structural soils: very high pH's</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Orjan Stahl's Swedish Structural Soils<ul>
      <li>Large stones at the bottom of the tree pit</li>
      <li>Soil is washed into the voids</li>
      <li>Repeat for the next layers with slightly smaller stones at each layer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Some notes for structural soils</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Structural soils can easily fail if not properly constructed<ul>
      <li>Stones must be large and angular enough to create abundant voids</li>
      <li>Soils must have sufficient water holding capacity (otherwise the soils will be too dry)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Structural soils are not “better” than native mineral soils. If anything, they are worst.<ul>
      <li>Structural soils are only meant <strong>to go under pavement!</strong> They are not a substitute for native mineral soils.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>They are useful for constructing “break out” zones around tree pits or for creating paths to a larger breakout zone.</li>
</ul>
