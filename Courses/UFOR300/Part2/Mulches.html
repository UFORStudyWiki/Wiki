<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Mulches go around the base of a tree or other plants. “mimics” litter layer in a forest.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Helps retain moisture</li>
  <li>Improves infiltration/reduces runoff</li>
  <li>Reduces competition from weeds<ul>
      <li>Blocks light from below and keeps seeds from germinating or from landing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can create a lovely seed bed.</li>
  <li>Doesn't help as much as people think (probably tons of herbicide being laid down where weeds are not present)</li>
  <li>Creates a visual boundary for trees (helps because people seem to like to mow down saplings)</li>
  <li>Moderates temperatures</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Concerns</h1>
<p>Woodchips have a C/N ratio of 1:400; compost of 1:20; What does this mean?</p>
<ul>
  <li>A mulch with high C/N ratio can cause nitrogen deficiency, especially if mixed in the soil</li>
  <li>Materials with lots of cellulose tend to have a higher C/N ratio</li>
  <li>The C/N ratio of wood chips will decrease as a mulch is aged</li>
  <li>The fineness of the material and extent of mixing play a large role in the influence of C/N ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Research shows this isn't usually an issue.</mark></p>
<h1>Types</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Aged, shredded hardwood bark</li>
