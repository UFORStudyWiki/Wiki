<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A tree condition assessment classifies trees into six broad categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dead or dying</li>
  <li>Poor</li>
  <li>Fair</li>
  <li>Good</li>
  <li>Excellent</li>
</ul>
<p>Health and structure are considered critical indicators for the longevity of service in street trees, park trees, and other similar trees. It requires the ability to interpret physical signs manifested by a given phenotype. However, keep in mind that it is critical to reflect on the purpose of the assessment; there is never a truly “good” tree.</p>
<p>In order to interpret phenotypes, an arborist should know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know the species (basically the genotype)<ul>
      <li>major cultivation and pest issues</li>
      <li>expected growth rates and forms</li>
      <li>structural issues and common failure patterns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Know the environment<ul>
      <li>below-ground conditions</li>
      <li>land use history</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
