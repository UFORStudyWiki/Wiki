<p>Trees are a part of the urban forest; Most municipalities have tree planting programs to ensure that their canopy continues over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New trees are also needed in urban capital projects. Arborists and Urban foresters play a role in this process.</p>
<p>The majority of planted urban trees are large. Landscape size (at least, 30 mm; frequently &gt;60mm diameter).</p>
<p>Nurseries have developed production techniques to produce large numbers of these trees at reasonable cost. However, propogation, production, harvesting, delivery, handling, and planting processes provide many opportunities for error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most urban trees are produced in one of the three production systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Container Grown</li>
  <li>Balled and burlapped (B &amp; B)</li>
  <li>Bare root</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nurseries will use all of these systems (or variations on the systems). Other nurseries specialize. Field nurseries (necessary for B &amp; B and bare root production) require lots of high quality agricultural land.&nbsp;</p>
