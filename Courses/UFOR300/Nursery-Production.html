<p>Trees are a part of the urban forest; Most municipalities have tree planting programs to ensure that their canopy continues over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New trees are also needed in urban capital projects. Arborists and Urban foresters play a role in this process.</p>
<p>The majority of planted urban trees are large. Landscape size (at least, 30 mm; frequently &gt;60mm diameter).</p>
<p>Nurseries have developed production techniques to produce large numbers of these trees at reasonable cost. However, propogation, production, harvesting, delivery, handling, and planting processes provide many opportunities for error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most urban trees are produced in one of the three production systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Container Grown</li>
  <li>Balled and burlapped (B &amp; B)</li>
  <li>Bare root</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nurseries will use all of these systems (or variations on the systems). Other nurseries specialize. Field nurseries (necessary for B &amp; B and bare root production) require lots of high quality agricultural land.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How a tree is produced</h1>
<p>Year 0: Lots of work goes into the selection of a tree</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seed hunting</li>
  <li>Breeding</li>
  <li>Selection and evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>Sent to Liner Grower</strong><br>Year 1: Tissue culture or cutting<br>Year 2: Outdoor liner bed<br>Year 3: Lining out in field<br>Year 4: Established Central Leader<br>Year 5: Root Prune &amp; Develop branching<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sent to Nursery Production.</strong><br>Year 6: Prune Roots &amp; Canopy; Plant in field<br>Year 7 - 8: Pruning, staking, Limb- up Harvest. 2"-3" Tree<br>Year 9: Harvest 3"-4" Tree</p>
<p>Typical end users include municipal, small to mid scale residential &amp; commercial. Retail nurseries, personal consumers.</p>
<p><br><strong>Sent to Large Tree Nursery Production</strong><br>Year 10-14: Transplant or Root Prune; Canopy Prune; Harvest 5"-6" Tree<br>Year 15: Harvest 8" - 10" Tree</p>
<p>Typical end users include high end residential &amp; commercial. Specimen, focal, point trees for institutional projects.</p>
<h1>Production Types</h1>
<h2>Balled and Burlapped (B &amp; B)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>5 - 10% of roots harvested</li>
  <li>Best to transplant while dormant</li>
  <li>Summer t'plant not recommended</li>
  <li>Can't really tell what's deep in the ball</li>
  <li>Only getting a very tiny portion of the roots</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bare Root Planting Stock</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Plant while dormant</li>
  <li>Usually smaller trees (5 cm caliper), some shrubs, daylilies, roses</li>
  <li>Deciduous trees</li>
  <li>small part of root system harvested</li>
  <li>Not suitable for all species</li>
</ul>
<h2>Container grown (not containerized)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>100% of root system</li>
  <li>Usually smaller plants (&lt;5 cm caliper), often whippy</li>
  <li>Plant whenever ground is not frozen</li>
</ul>
