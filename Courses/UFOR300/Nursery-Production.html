<p>Trees are a part of the urban forest; Most municipalities have tree planting programs to ensure that their canopy continues over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New trees are also needed in urban capital projects. Arborists and Urban foresters play a role in this process.</p>
<p>The majority of planted urban trees are large. Landscape size (at least, 30 mm; frequently &gt;60mm diameter).</p>
<p>Nurseries have developed production techniques to produce large numbers of these trees at reasonable cost. However, propogation, production, harvesting, delivery, handling, and planting processes provide many opportunities for error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most urban trees are produced in one of the three production systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Container Grown</li>
  <li>Balled and burlapped (B &amp; B)</li>
  <li>Bare root</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nurseries will use all of these systems (or variations on the systems). Other nurseries specialize. Field nurseries (necessary for B &amp; B and bare root production) require lots of high quality agricultural land.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>How a tree is produced</h1>
<p>Year 0: Lots of work goes into the selection of a tree</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seed hunting</li>
  <li>Breeding</li>
  <li>Selection and evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>Sent to Liner Grower</strong><br>Year 1: Tissue culture or cutting<br>Year 2: Outdoor liner bed<br>Year 3: Lining out in field<br>Year 4: Established Central Leader<br>Year 5: Root Prune &amp; Develop branching<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sent to Nursery Production.</strong><br>Year 6: Prune Roots &amp; Canopy; Plant in field<br>Year 7 - 8: Pruning, staking, Limb- up Harvest. 2"-3" Tree<br>Year 9: Harvest 3"-4" Tree</p>
<p>Typical end users include municipal, small to mid scale residential &amp; commercial. Retail nurseries, personal consumers.</p>
<p><br><strong>Sent to Large Tree Nursery Production</strong><br>Year 10-14: Transplant or Root Prune; Canopy Prune; Harvest 5"-6" Tree<br>Year 15: Harvest 8" - 10" Tree</p>
<p>Typical end users include high end residential &amp; commercial. Specimen, focal, point trees for institutional projects.</p>
<h1>Production Types</h1>
<h2>Balled and Burlapped (B &amp; B)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>5 - 10% of roots harvested</li>
  <li>Best to transplant while dormant</li>
  <li>Summer t'plant not recommended</li>
  <li>Can't really tell what's deep in the ball</li>
  <li>Only getting a very tiny portion of the roots</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bare Root Planting Stock</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Plant while dormant</li>
  <li>Usually smaller trees (5 cm caliper), some shrubs, daylilies, roses</li>
  <li>Deciduous trees</li>
  <li>small part of root system harvested</li>
  <li>Not suitable for all species</li>
</ul>
<h2>Container grown (not containerized)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>100% of root system</li>
  <li>Usually smaller plants (&lt;5 cm caliper), often whippy</li>
  <li>Plant whenever ground is not frozen</li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">NOTE: Distinguished from “containerized” trees, which are bare root trees placed in containers with growing media for re-sale.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pot in Pot systems</h3>
<p>Increases the range of container production by allowing it to occur in colder regions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prior to pot in pot systems, container growing could only occur in warmer temperatures</li>
</ul>
<p>They:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protect roots from the cold</li>
  <li>Capture water run-off<ul>
      <li>Can be recycled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Countless other benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Architecture of a nursery root system</h1>
<p>Root shank: Portion of the tree that isn't entirely clear if it's root or shoot tissue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the tree wasn't grown in a nursery, roots would likely have grown in this place.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Container grown trees</h2>
<p>Pot bound roots are an issue. Roots start circling the pot.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very difficult to get a high-quality pot grown tree<ul>
      <li>Need a very professional / expert grower to achieve this.</li>
      <li>One solution:<ul>
          <li>Coat inside of pot with copper paint (i.e., spin-out™) .</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>How to inspect a tree for good quality</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Two-thirds rule<ul>
      <li>Enough canopy covering enough of the tree</li>
      <li>Lollipoping will stress out the tree and is bad for new plants.<ul>
          <li>Lollipoping is where the lower branches are pruned away</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Central Leader<ul>
      <li>Multiple leaders / forked trunks can be difficult to correct for. Leads to splits and diseases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Last minute corrections via pruning</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that they follow standards &amp; guidelines</p>
