  <li>If you were managing the urban forest on the UBC campus, would you have condition assessments performed on all trees every year? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Can you articulate three reasons why native plants are desirable in urban forests?</li>
  <li>Can you articulate three reasons why non-native plants are desirable in urban forests?</li>
  <li>How does an understanding of niche help us understand urban plant/environment interactions?</li>
  <li>What does it mean to "work with nature"? Would you consider all goals accomplished with the assistance of plants examples of using "nature-based solutions"?</li>
  <li>Many bottomland species (for example, American elm) are very successful urban trees even though we think of cities as being hot and dry. Why is this?</li>
  <li>If you have an older large tree in decline along a street, does it make sense to plant a young tree beneath it to take its place when it dies? What factors do you consider?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between a cultivar and a registered trademark?</li>
  <li>If a species only grows in standing water or periodically inundated sites in natural settings, what does that tell me about its realized niche? What about its fundamental niche? Which one is more important when selecting a tree species to plant at a given site?</li>
  <li>Why might references about tree species characteristics developed for rural environments require additional interpretation when applied to urban environments? For example, The Silvics of North America is a great reference about some trees--but are all the characteristics described in this reference going to be true in an urban environment?</li>
  <li>How far do roots spread and how deep to they go? What do you need to know about a tree or a site to make this type of assessment?</li>
  <li>Describe 2 or 3 scenarios where knowing where roots are likely to extend might be important.</li>
  <li>What are some examples of indicator plants in urban settings? What does the&nbsp; plant indicate?</li>
  <li>Why are structural soils useful? Where would you use these soils if you were designing a streetscape?</li>
  <li>Who develops standards and why are they useful?</li>
  <li>Is one production system better than another?</li>
  <li>How would you determine if a certain species would be appropriate for bare root planting?</li>
  <li>Can you explain why the 2/3 rule is useful?</li>
  <li>What is a root shank?</li>
  <li>What are the most common limitations to tree selection?</li>
  <li>What tree selection strategies would best contribute to increasing genetic and functional diversity in an urban forest?</li>
  <li>If you were in charge of a planting program for the UBC Campus, what information would you need to gather about UBC Campus urban forest before embarking on a species selection process?</li>
  <li>What are some different perspectives on tree selection that you might encounter in the professional world?</li>
  <li>What geographic range would you use to define "native"? Why?</li>
