<p>This is/was written by a student who did moderately well in the midterm. <strong>Do not</strong> rely on this as the sole pathway to an A+ grade. <i>Rather, use this guide as a way to supplement your own studying style.</i></p>
<p>Here are a few tips from your peers on how to best: 1) ace, 2) manage, and 3) survive this course. Hopefully, you don't end up in the third scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take notes on paper. Paper writing is a good way to make information stick. If you prefer taking notes online, try writing them out on paper later.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>The best note-taking method</strong> that I found personally is to write them out in paragraph form in your own words. Or at least take bullet points during the lectures and then use them to form your sentences. Summarizing and synthesizing content can help things make sense and discover information gaps. This is especially important because this course looks for <i>critical thinking and application</i>, not entirely data memorization.</li>
  <li>Meet up with your fellow students to talk about and/or revisit the module materials together. In-person is recommended, but meeting online is better than no meeting at all. I discovered many pieces of information that I missed during the lectures and readings. Then it appeared on the exam!</li>
  <li>Ask questions to your instructor and TAs! Visit them during their office hours/friendly events.</li>
  <li>Go out for a walk and look at urban trees! Try to apply what you learned in your observations. Questions, clarity, and aha-moments will surely come up!</li>
  <li>Use flashcards, online or physical. Creating flashcards helped me associate meaning to specific terms.</li>
  <li>Create a mind map to supplement the previous steps. I find that mind maps alone will not solidify knowledge, but using them with effective note-taking and peer discussions do help.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get good sleep! The more sleep-deprived, the less likely it is for information to stick.</li>
</ul>
