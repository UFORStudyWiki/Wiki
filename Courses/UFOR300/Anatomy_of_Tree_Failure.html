<h1>Terminology to Know</h1>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> - the possibility of something undesirable or destructive happening. In this case, the “risk” of a tree is considered in terms of dangers to humans. So if a tree falls on a wilderness space far from people traffic, the risk is considered “low” or even zero.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> - a very special, arboriculture-specific term that refers to a part of a tree breaking off or falling down. A “ branch failed” means that a branch has fallen off. A “tree failed” means that the entire tree fell down.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Defect</strong> - A possible characteristic that could lead to tree failure.</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> - anything that might be damaged by a tree failure.</p>
