<p>You have two soils, a sandy soil and a clayey soil. Which soil do you expect will have a greater change in soil strength over a range of soil moisture contents?&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>the clayey soil&nbsp;</li>
  <li>the sandy soil&nbsp;</li>
  <li>they will have the same change in soil strength&nbsp;</li>
  <li>soil strength is a fundamental quality in soils and does not change&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>You planted a Southern magnolia (<i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>) tree in honor of your parents 5 years ago and it is doing well and is now 8 cm dbh. However, there is a severe summer drought and you would like to water the entire root system once a week to make sure it thrives. How far out from the trunk do you estimate the root system extends so you can position your drip irrigation line accordingly? Explain your reasoning, draw a picture if helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to spring-transplanted trees, fall-transplanted plants will likely…&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>initiate root growth earlier in the spring&nbsp;</li>
  <li>require more frequent irrigation&nbsp;</li>
  <li>have a coarser root system&nbsp;</li>
  <li>have less root turnover&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Pavement placed around trees will likely….&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>result in more roots near the soil surface&nbsp;</li>
  <li>allow more rapid water infiltration&nbsp;</li>
  <li>result in more fine root production and fewer structural roots&nbsp;</li>
  <li>encourage the formation of tap roots to access the water table&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding crushed limestone to soil tends to…&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>raise pH&nbsp;</li>
  <li>lower pH&nbsp;</li>
  <li>increase soil compaction&nbsp;</li>
  <li>enhance salt tolerance&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In its natural setting baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) is found in swamps, sometimes in standing water. It competes well in this environment because it tolerates standing water and does not tolerate fire. However it is also grows successfully when planted in upland urban sites, including in tree pits in urban centers far outside its native range. This tolerance for a broad range of soil moisture conditions is indicative of this tree’s</p>
<ol>
  <li>fundamental niche&nbsp;</li>
  <li>native range&nbsp;</li>
  <li>realized niche&nbsp;</li>
  <li>excellent stomatal control You are assessing the health of a large tree and after making your assessment you notice several large conks (mushroom growths) 2 to 3 m up the trunk that you hadn’t spotted earlier. You… a. downgrade your condition rating&nbsp;</li>
  <li>disregard these, most conks are ephemeral&nbsp;</li>
  <li>consider it can probably be disregarded, but break off a piece of conk to see if it is still alive to confirm&nbsp;</li>
  <li>upgrade your condition rating&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are doing a condition assessment of a 24 cm trunk diameter deciduous hardwood tree, <i>Acer saccharum</i> (sugar maple), in the winter in Toronto.&nbsp; You notice that it has retained almost all its leaves, even at the end of its branches. They are brown and shriveled but still hanging from the branches. What does this tell you about the condition of the tree?&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>If newer leaves on a plant are yellowing, this may be a symptom of… a. Fe excess&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Ca deficiency&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Fe or Mg deficiency&nbsp;</li>
  <li>N deficiency&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the following usually indicates tree stress?&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The absence of fruit&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The absence of lichen on the bark&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The absence of mature foliage (as opposed to juvenile)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Early fall coloration for that species.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are various protocols for assigning condition ratings to trees that are maintained by various organizations for various purposes. All of the entities below will have condition rating systems of sorts. Which is most likely to be used in legal disputes about individual trees (for example, if a property&nbsp; owner cuts down her neighbor’s tree)? The protocol from… a. i-Tree Eco&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>An individual consulting company (their proprietary protocol)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Urban Foresty Inventory and Analysis (from the US Forest Service)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does a tree condition assessment also include a tree risk assessment? (Yes or No)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When two co-dominant stems expand in diameter so they are pressed tightly together you are likely to find _____________________________in between these stems. The presence of this is considered a point of structural weakness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Describe a situation where the Canadian Hardiness Zone system would be useful to you as an urban forester?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Describe a microclimate that could be created by the built environment. Give an example of how this microclimate might affect trees? (short answer)&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the difference between a cultivar and a registered trademark? (short answer)</p>
<p><i>Platanus xhispanica</i> (London plane) is native to environments with plentiful water. Therefore, this species has not developed strong stomatal control mechanisms (when soil is dry, stomata may not close quickly). Instead, they survive dry periods by shedding leaves. This is an example of a(n)… a. phenological adaptation&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>xerophytic strategy&nbsp;</li>
  <li>instance of competitive exclusion&nbsp;</li>
  <li>plant biome&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Describe two mechanisms by which turfgrass, such as tall fescue can inhibit the growth of nearby trees. Use specific terminology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison to other production systems, container-grown trees are LESS likely to….&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>have girdling roots&nbsp;</li>
  <li>be whippy (have reduced trunk taper)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>meet the Canadian Standard for Nursery Stock&nbsp;</li>
  <li>produced in colder climates&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are selecting trees to plant in the median in Wesbrook Mall (the strip of land in the middle of the street). It has already been decided that you will plant <i>Ulmus americana</i> ‘Princeton’ . What size and production system will you specify? Be specific (give exact size, for example). Justify your answer.&nbsp;</p>
