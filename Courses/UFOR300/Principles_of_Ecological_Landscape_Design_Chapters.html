<p>This is a page summarizing concepts introduced in the Principles of Ecological Landscape Design by Beck (2013).</p>
<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>In a natural setting, plant species grow in populations (groups of individuals). Populations are never static and uniform, as they are diverse in age, size, height, and genetic tolerance to climate conditions. This allows populations to be resilient by making them dynamic. Designers should consider planting dynamic populations of different individuals and cultivars with varying age groups and characteristics.</p>
<p>Populations of different species grow together as communities. Mimicking locally seen communities would allow for a dynamic landscape that settles into the site quickly by pruning off unsuccessful species over time and establishing those that are.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create planting strategies that complement or work together with spatial processes seen in ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Integrate genetic diversity into the planting strategy to create “evolvable” populations that are diverse.</li>
  <li>Consider planting plant individuals of various age and size groups.</li>
  <li>Incorporate the concept of intraspecific competition to allow self-thinning of stands.</li>
  <li>Encourage populations to change through time.</li>
  <li>Create planting strategies that build plant communities.</li>
</ul>
