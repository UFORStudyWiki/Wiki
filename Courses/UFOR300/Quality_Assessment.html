<h1>What is a good quality tree?</h1>
<p>A good quality tree from the nursery should have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good vigor</li>
  <li>Healthy, fresh appearance (not a miniature version of a mature tree)</li>
  <li>Pest-free condition</li>
  <li>Good root system</li>
  <li>Straight, wound-free trunk</li>
  <li>proper handling</li>
</ul>
<h1>Calipers&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Caliper is the above-ground diameter of a nursery tree trunk at a defined height.</p>
<p>According to the Canadian Nursery Standard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The caliper will be the default measurement when the said caliper is more than 40 mm. For young trees, the caliper will be measured at 15 cm above the soil line, and it should be up to 100 mm. Larger trees will have the caliper measured at 30 cm above the soil line. This should be greater than 100 mm. If the caliper is greater than 100 mm, the tree will be considered not young.</li>
</ul>
