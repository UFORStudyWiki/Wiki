<h1>What is soil pH?</h1>
<p>Soil pH refers to the acidity / alkalinity of the soil. Logarithmic scale from 0-14 (7 is neutral) that indicates the hydrogen ion concentration in the soil solution (water in the soil).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low pH is more acidic.</p>
<p>High pH is more basic.</p>
<h1>How to measure pH?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Standard soil test by a soils lab (when you're already sending something to the lab for other purposes)</li>
  <li>Meter (relatively inexpensive at ~$100). Can sample the soil at various places quickly and easily.</li>
  <li>Colormetric kits (Cheap but takes more time to do)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Significance</h1>
<p>Many plants are very sensitive to soil pH and are unable to extract certain nutrients from soils if the pH is too low or too high. A shift from 7 to 6 is drastic!!!</p>
<p>- High pH's result in some nutrients/metals being bound tightly to soil particles.</p>
<p>- Low pH's result in higher heavy metals being more available for uptake.</p>
<p>It's important to know the pH of the soil so that appropriate planting decisions can be made.</p>

<h1>Soils in Vancouver</h1>
<p>Vancouver soils tend to have a low pH. Granitic stone and gravel is often used in construction, meaning that soil pH is rarely too high.</p>
<p>In regions where there is limestone bedrock or where limestone is used in construction, soil pH's above 7.5 or 8 are common in urban areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Changing pH</h1>
<p>Elemental Sulphur lowers pH level by <strong>Sulfur bacterium.</strong></p>
<p>Wood Ash raises pH level by mixing with soil water to form lye.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">NOTE: It's very difficult to lower soil pH in a real-world setting.&nbsp;</mark></p>
