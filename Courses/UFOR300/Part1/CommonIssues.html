<h1>Issue 1: Not enough soil</h1>
<p>When there isn't enough soil, the tree will reach the carrying capacity of the available soil.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stunted growth</li>
  <li>Reduced foliage</li>
  <li>Trees take on the characteristics of old trees (rough bark, etc.)</li>
  <li>Death</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solutions:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Special underground planting spaces<ul>
      <li>Vaulted sidewalks;<ul>
          <li>Sidewalk is suspended about 10 cm's above open soils</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>smaller, modular versions of vaulted sidewalks<ul>
          <li>i.e., Silva cells</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Special “compactable” soils (structural soils, skeletal soils)<ul>
      <li>Modern construction techniques compact soils pretty hard to prevent pavings from sinking or shifting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Access tunnels to larger soil areas<ul>
      <li>Tunnels to access nearby parks?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design solutions<ul>
      <li>Maximize space with design, both above ground and below ground</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>High quality soils provide more resources</li>
</ul>
<h1>Issue 2: Soil doesn't drain</h1>
<p>Presence of “Gleying”: Blueish-gray color that indicates low oxygen conditions in the soil (reduced iron). Also visible by water not draining from the soils or indicator plant species.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many trees intolerant of poor drainage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indicator plant species</h2>
<p>Unlike in “natural” environments, such as forests, species are mostly managed under a city context. Indicator plant species are not used by whether or not they're present in an area, rather, they're used by the conditions in which they are present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yews are a good indicator for poor drainage</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leaves turn brown in poor drainage situations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Remove cause of poor drainage if possible</li>
  <li>Install sub-surface drainage to an outlet</li>
  <li>Use plants tolerant of poor drainage</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
