<p>How can we work with trees in our urban plantings?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional pattern is &nbsp;as an art-form: Clear everything and start over as a clean slate. Widely spaced trees with grass in-between them.</li>
  <li>Can we incorporate and manage what's there?</li>
  <li>Aboriculture affects the structural components of an ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lecture 3 focuses on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plants and the environment</li>
  <li>Genotype and cultivars</li>
  <li>Plant nomenclature</li>
</ul>
<h1>Plants and the environment</h1>
<p>Trees can't flee from danger; they're rooted!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adapted techniques to deal with this: shedding leaves, etc.</li>
  <li>IMPORTANT: The plant environment supports plants<ul>
      <li><mark class="marker-yellow">genotype X environment = phenotype</mark>
        <ul>
          <li>Artists often treat plants like “widgets” (static, mechanical objects)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Growth of the current year is affected by that of previous years (bud set).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The plant and its environment are part of a larger system that performs ecosystem processes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Genotype and cultivars</h1>
<p>Genotype X environment = phenotype</p>
<p>Genotype: What are the genetics of your tree?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monoculture bad: taught m</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Review: Plant processes &amp; terms to know</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Transpiration</li>
  <li>Photosynthesis</li>
  <li>Respiration</li>
  <li>Transpiration cooling</li>
  <li>Evapotranspiration</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
