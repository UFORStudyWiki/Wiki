<h1>Soil Volume</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Urban forest research has tried to answer / address how to deal with limited soil volume for trees in cities for many years.</li>
  <li>Cities have only recently introduced soil volume guidelines.</li>
  <li>How much soil is required for trees?<ul>
      <li>Difficult to answer; one variable is the root architecture of a tree if it weren't restricted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Estimating root spread</h1>
<p>To estimate root spread of a tree where there is no impediment to the roots:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Measure</strong> trunk <strong>diameter </strong>(circumference / pi)</li>
  <li><strong>Multiply </strong>the number <strong>by 38</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Below-ground coompetition</h1>
<p>There is limited space below ground; two things can't occupy the same place: competition</p>
<p>We need to determine&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>root location</li>
  <li>root spread;</li>
  <li>Root depth;</li>
  <li>Root interaction with soil</li>
  <li>Species influence over previous bullet points&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
