<h1>Basics</h1>
<p>Soils make the foundation of urban tree canopy, without good soils</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establishment is difficult / poor</li>
  <li>Growth is &nbsp;poor</li>
  <li>Canopy formation is poor</li>
</ul>
<p>Soils are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Soil management challenge</li>
  <li>A Design challenge</li>
  <li>A Engineering challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Urban soils have vastly different challenges from rural soils</p>
<ul>
  <li>Principles of soil science are the same, but challenges are different.</li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Soils directly influence tree phenotype.</mark></p>
<h1>Soil Volume</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Urban forest research has tried to answer / address how to deal with limited soil volume for trees in cities for many years.</li>
  <li>Cities have only recently introduced soil volume guidelines.</li>
  <li>How much soil is required for trees?<ul>
      <li>Difficult to answer; one variable is the root architecture of a tree if it weren't restricted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

        <td>20 m<sup>3</sup> (single tree)<br>15 m<sup>3</sup> (row of trees)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Small (Snowbell)</td>
        <td>10 m<sup>3</sup> (single tree)<br>5 m<sup>3</sup> (row of trees)</td>

<h1>Estimating root spread</h1>
<p>To estimate root spread of a tree where there is no impediment to the roots:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Measure</strong> trunk <strong>diameter </strong>(circumference / pi)</li>
  <li><strong>Multiply </strong>the number <strong>by 38</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Below-ground competition</h1>
<p>There is limited space below ground; two things can't occupy the same place: competition</p>
<p>We need to determine&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>root location</li>
  <li>root spread;</li>
  <li>Root depth;</li>
  <li>Root interaction with soil</li>
  <li>Species influence over previous bullet points</li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">NOTE: For very large trees, there is not much actual data available on root spread.</mark></p>
<p>Root systems are massive on large trees, quantifying them is very difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Allelopathy</h1>
<p>Some plants, such as walnut, produces chemicals to gain competitive advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walnut roots excrete juglone which inhibits the growth of some other plants.</li>
  <li>Tall fescue (<i>Festuca arundinacea</i>) suppresses the growth of a wide variety of tree species.</li>
</ul>
