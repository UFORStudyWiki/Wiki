<h1>Issue 1: Not enough soil</h1>
<p>When there isn't enough soil, the tree will reach the carrying capacity of the available soil.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stunted growth</li>
  <li>Reduced foliage</li>
  <li>Trees take on the characteristics of old trees (rough bark, etc.)</li>
  <li>Death</li>
</ul>
<h1>Issue 2: Soil doesn't drain</h1>
<p>Presence of “Gleying”: Blueish-gray color that indicates low oxygen conditions in the soil (reduced iron). Also visible by water not draining from the soils or indicator plant species.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many trees intolerant of poor drainage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indicator plant species</h2>
<p>Unlike in “natural” environments, such as forests, species are mostly managed under a city context. Indicator plant species are not used by whether or not they're present in an area, rather, they're used by the conditions in which they are present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yews are a good indicator for poor drainage</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leaves turn brown in poor drainage situations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Remove cause of poor drainage if possible</li>
  <li>Install sub-surface drainage to an outlet</li>
  <li>Use plants tolerant of poor drainage</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
