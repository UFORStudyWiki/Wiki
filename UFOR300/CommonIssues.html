<h1>Issue 1: Not enough soil</h1>
<p>When there isn't enough soil, the tree will reach the carrying capacity of the available soil.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stunted growth</li>
  <li>Reduced foliage</li>
  <li>Trees take on the characteristics of old trees (rough bark, etc.)</li>
  <li>Death</li>
</ul>
<h1>Issue 2: Soil doesn't drain</h1>
<p>Presence of “Gleying”: Blueish-gray color that indicates low oxygen conditions in the soil (reduced iron). Also visible by water not draining from the soils or indicator plant species.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many trees intolerant of poor drainage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indicator plant species</h2>
<p>Unlike in “natural” environments, such as forests,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
