<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the course directory for the Study Gang Wiki! We are a small community of forestry students looking to collaboratively contribute to high-quality course notes. If you have any questions, please direct them to “olson@student.ubc.ca”!</p>
<p>Here are a few gentle reminders for how to use this wiki</p>
<ul>
  <li>Please do not upload course contents as this would violate copyright law. Rather, please summarize notes in your own words. Please cite if you are directly referring to a resource.</li>
  <li>Please do not share this wiki readily with everyone that you know. Rather, please share this wiki with peers who will: 1) absolutely benefit from the materials in this wiki, and 2) absolutely follow these guidelines provided here.</li>
</ul>
