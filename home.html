<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the course directory for the Study Gang Wiki! We are a small community of forestry students looking to collaboratively contribute to high-quality course notes. If you have any questions, please direct them to “olson@student.ubc.ca”!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not upload course contents as this would violate copyright law. Rather, please summarize notes in your own words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Current courses</h1>
<p>&nbsp;Feel free to create a new section for a course that you're taking notes for.</p>
